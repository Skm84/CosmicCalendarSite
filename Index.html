        This week we were getting ready to present at the CDR, while Sumaanyu worked hard on the trifold and the brochure while I polished the prototype. To make the prototype easier on the eyes I decided to make a simple UI for our judges to interact with during the CDR. All in all, we feel excited with our progress and feel that we’ve learned a lot from our time at NASA HUNCH, regardless of the outcome of the CDR. That being said, we're really hoping that we'll be able to keep working on this project and keep learning from Mr. Hayes.

      <h2>Problem and Solution</h2>
      <p>
        As we move into an age where the logical next step in space exploration is not only putting probes on further planets but also putting people there—especially with a manned mission to Mars sooner rather than later—the question of “how do we schedule data transfer or meetings?” arises. Our solution is a system that takes a date and a time from any one planet and adjusts it for the timezone, returning a new date and time on the other planet. This would allow us to standardize timing among planets and reduce friction in scheduling and data transfer.

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating a website where people can download our files and see weekly updates on our projects</li>
        <li>Implementing more than two conversions at once</li>
        <li>Implementing a calendar system with a login</li>
        <li>Hosting the prototype so that we can get feedback from a variety of people</li>
        <li>Changing our prototype to adjust for a lag in data transfer</li>
